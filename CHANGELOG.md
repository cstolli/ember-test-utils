* **Fixed**: Issue with using `.eslintrc.js` in this repo (Resolves [#86](https://github.com/ciena-blueplanet/ember-test-utils/issues/86))

# 5.0.0 (2017-05-26)
 * **Update** `engine` in `package.json` to `>=6.9.1`. We've only been testing on `6.9.1` and `stable` anyway, but this makes it official that we don't suport `node@5` anymore. 
* **Addedd** the ability for `lint-javascript` and `lint-htmlbars` to accept a single file to lint on the command line. This is to enable the new `ember-cli-frost-blueprints` to lint the files it generates one at a time and get specific errors for only the file in question.

* **Added** mock-component helper that is being used to test component dependency injection patterns in frost repos
* **Added** tests for mock-component helper
* **Updated** README to document `mock-component` helper
* **Updated** README to document `adapter`, `helper` and `service` module test helpers
* **Updated** README to document `stubService` helper

# 4.1.1 (2017-05-05)
* **Updated** bower packages to npm packages
* **Updated** ember-try config to work with npm ember-source
* **Updated** path to resolver
* **Removed** unneeded files and config from `ember-cli-mirage` which is no longer installed

# 4.1.0 (2017-05-05)

* **Added** more test setup helpers to support other common modules that utilizes the factory (services, adapters, helpers)


# 4.0.0 (2017-03-23)

* **Upgraded** to eslint-config-frost-standard 6.x


# 3.0.0
* **Removed** `ember-intl` helpers since they didn't seem to be working anymore anyway, and we're not sure we want to encourage `ember-intl` over `ember-i18n` yet
* **Removed** `ember-data` helpers `stubStore` and `returnPromiseWithArgs` they have been replaced with `stubService` and `returnPromiseFromStub` out of the `stub` module now.
* **Added** `stub` helper module that contains `stubService` and `returnPromiseFromStub` methods: 
  ```js
  import {returnPromiseFromStub, stubService} from 'ember-test-utils/test-support/stub'
  ```
* **Added** `actions` helpers that currently just has `callAction` helper method for calling an action in tests.


# 2.0.0
## Breaking Changes
 * **Moved** helpers from `test-support` to `addon-test-support` so the way they are consumed has changed. See [#40](https://github.com/ciena-blueplanet/ember-test-utils/issues/40) for details. 
 * **Removed** deprecated `describeComponent` style helpers (See [#11](https://github.com/ciena-blueplanet/ember-test-utils/issues/11) for details)
* **Fixed** an issue where the `serializer` helper was adding a `model:foo` to the `dependencies` automatically instead of a `serializer:foo`. Since we use `setupModelTest` it should be the `serializer` that gets added as a dependency, not the `model`, since that will already be loaded via the `setupModelTest` method. 


# 1.11.0

* **Replaced** bower dependencies with node dependencies.
* **Updated** `ember-lodash-shim` to version `2.0.0` which shaves over 150 KB off of production builds.


# 1.10.7
**Added** `chalk` to dependencies


# 1.10.6

* Attempt to fix build by disable dependency snapshot which is causing build to fail and not publish.

# 1.10.4

* **Fixed** build so it'll publish.

# 1.10.3

* **Fixed** bug in Javascript linter around ESLint inconsistency with `globals` key. In a `.eslintrc` config it expects `globals` to be an object but when using the `CLIEngine` it expects an array.


# 1.10.2

* **Fixed** markdown linter to use correct default config file.


# 1.10.1

* **Fixed** `lint-sass` to use `.sass-lint.yml` instead of `.sass-lint.json` as that is what in editor linting expects
to be present.


# 1.10.0

* **Added** new Node executables for linting: `lint-all-the-things`, `lint-docker`, `lint-htmlbars` (previously
  `template-lint`), `lint-javascript`, `lint-markdown`, and `lint-sass`.


# 1.9.0

* **Added** new `template-lint` executable for linting HTMLBars templates.


# 1.8.0

* **Added** `ember-lodash-shim` configuration to optimize build to only include necessary `lodash` methods.
* **Added** `ember-disable-prototype-extensions` to ensure addon isn't depending on Ember's prototype extensions.


# 1.7.0

* **Added** dots to test reporter so it is visually obvious tests are executing.


# 1.6.1

* **Upgraded** to test against Ember 2.11.


# 1.6.0

* **Removed** files from npm package that aren't necessary (all of the various config files).
* **Updated** dependencies to latest versions.


# 1.5.1
* Change CI browser example in *README.md* to match `ember-frost-core` usage

# 1.5.0
* **Added** a helper to stub out the ember-data store and make it easy to fake responses to calls to the store.
* **Updated** the dummy route and unit test for route to utilize the ember-data helper.

# 1.4.0

* **Added** support to automatically add `ember-intl` dependencies to unit tests that specify `service:intl` in their
dependencies
* **Updated** lint rules and fixed new warnings


# 1.3.2

* **Fixed** custom reporter to work for consumers using Node 5.


# 1.3.1
* **Added** tests for use with old versions of ember
* **Fixed** issue when used with `ember@2.3` (no `Ember.assign` available)


# 1.3.0
* **Updated** - `ember-mocha` dependency
* **Added** - Helpers to make using `setupTest()`, `setupComponentTest()` and `setupModelTest()` easier.
* **Deprecated** - the `describeComponent()`, `describeModel()` and `describeModule()` helpers
* **Deprecated** - the `diffObject()` method (we'll hopefully incorporate it into a chai addon soon, see #12)

# 1.2.2

* **Fixes** issue where skipped test conditions were being *skipped` since it was actually *pending*


# 1.2.1

* **Improved** custom mocha reporter to show failures as they occur and only show passed tests when all pass (now
  sorting fastest to slowest to reduce a user from having to scroll as much in their terminal).

<!--lint disable maximum-line-length-->

When there are failures without stack traces it'll look like this:

<!--lint enable maximum-line-length-->

# 1.2.0

* **Added** custom mocha reporter which can be used by consumers.


# 1.1.2

- **Fixed** generated test names to use `/` instead of `|` as the test name separator, grep-ing the interactive web
app can link to unique tests.


# 1.1.1
* **Fixed** test descriptions to be consistent in the format of `Unit | Component | my-component` instead of
`Unit: MyComponentComponent` so that `grep`-ing for your component name will actually find tests for your component
now.
 * **Added** unit tests for the helpers themselves to make sure descriptions remain correct.

# 1.1.0
*  **Added** a `serializer` shortcut to the `describe-model` module which yields a
`Unit | Serializer | model-name` description compared to the `Unit | Model | model-name` that the `model` shortcut
yields.



# 1.0.0
## Breaking Changes
 * **Removed** `registryHelper` functionality (it isn't as necessary/useful with the introduction of `ember-hook`
 to make things less brittle.
 * **Moved** remaining code to `test-support/helpers/ember-test-utils` so consumers can have it injected into
 `tests/helpers` instead of treating it like a normal addon which will have code injected into the main app code tree.

## Non-breaking changes
 * **Added** helpers for `describeComponent` to make writing unit and integration tests easier
 * **Added** helpers for `describeModel` to make writing unit tests easier
 * **Added** helpers for `describeModule` to make writing uni tests easier.
